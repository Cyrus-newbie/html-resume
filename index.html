    setting my sights on a future in Data Science. Post-graduation, I aim to leverage my web development expertise 
    while gradually transitioning into a Data Analyst role, where I can integrate my ability to design intuitive digital 
    experiences with analytical insights. A proactive learner and problem-solver, [Your Name] is committed to delivering
